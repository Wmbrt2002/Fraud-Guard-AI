# 🛡️ Fraud Guard AI: Hybrid Credit Card Fraud Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
**Fraud Guard AI** is a real-time, privacy-preserving financial security system designed to detect credit card fraud. By combining Supervised and Unsupervised machine learning, this system overcomes traditional limitations such as imbalanced data and evolving fraud tactics.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Hybrid Architecture:** Combines **Random Forest** (for known patterns) and **Isolation Forest** (for anomaly detection).
* **Privacy-Preserving:** Utilizes **PCA** to anonymize sensitive customer attributes (PII) before analysis.
* **Imbalanced Data Handling:** Applies **SMOTE** to balance the training dataset.
* **High Performance:** Achieved an Accuracy of 99% and a Recall of 0.97.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
* **Languages:** Python 3.10+
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn, Imbalanced-Learn (SMOTE)
* **Web & API:** FastAPI, Streamlit
* **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
